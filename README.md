My prject is in the master branch.

My project is a store for my wife's art. The home page is an about me page. The Second page is a gallery to view her work and get a understanding of the type of work a person could comission her for. The third page is a conact a page to get a hold of her and request a custom piece of art.

The first feature is a css feature. A hamburger menu that appears in two media queries for a phone screen and a smaller screen like a tablet or small notebook.

The second feature is a flexbox to style the hamburger menu to work on mobile screens.

The third feature is a contact form that requires all the fields to be properly filled out in order for it to successfully submit.
    1. Name field must be 5 characters or more.
    2. The subject field for what type of art you'd want must be 5 characters of more.
    3. The phone number field must be 10 characters/
    4. The email field must include the "@" symbol and must at least be 6 characters or more.
    5. The message field must be 140 characters or more to fully describe the piece you would be rquesting.

I've included a forth feature for the gallery page that has lightboxs for the pictures. When clicking on the thumb nail the picture in larges and when clicking on the inlarged image it moves to the next image. Clicking outside the image closes the lightbox. A discription is under each image. This feature was built with a dev plug in.
